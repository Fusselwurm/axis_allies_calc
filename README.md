# what

This is a battle calculator for the Axis & Allies 1940 board game.

# setup

It is purely html+css+javascript, so just download the files to one directory, open the index.html with your browser and you're good.

# how

Enter the number and type of defending and attacking units into the input fields at the top.
Units are separated by commas. Prefixing numbers must be integers. When the auto-completion hint for the unit name you have started to enter appears, you may hit Ctrl+Space to accept.

After you have added all units you want to participate in the battle, hit Return or press "calculate".

Units will be hit and removed in the order in which they appear in the input fields.

You may adjust the number of simulations to run.

# restrictions

Rules for sea battles, amphibious assaults and anti aircraft guns are missing completely.

Distributing hits is very primitive (order of units in the input fields).
